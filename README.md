## About ##

Philosophers (represented by parts of a program) sit around a table, with a big plate of spaghetti at its center. They each have a fork, but they need two forks to eat ; so they need to borrow their neighbor's fork to eat.

Of course, if they borrow a neighbor's fork, the neighbor can't use the fork. The processes / threads must communicate, to know the state of the forks (and of the other philosophers) at all times. There must also be a parent process that monitors everything.
